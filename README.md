# Project README - Fine-Tuning MLP using Genetic Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for fine-tuning a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model using Python, specifically in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It involves various libraries and components for data preprocessing, model training, and genetic algorithm optimization.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several files and directories:

- `main.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the core implementation and execution of the project.
- `genetic_algorithm.py`: This module includes functions for implementing the Genetic Algorithm, including selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Contains functions responsible for data preprocessing tasks, such as standardization and normalization of the dataset.
- `data_loader.py`: Provides functions for splitting datasets into data loaders or batches, facilitating model training.
- `model.py`: This file contains the detailed definition of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model using `MLPClassifier` from `sklearn.neural_network`.
- `train.py`: Contains the code for training the MLP model with the preprocessed data and the genetic algorithm for fine-tuning.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization and plotting.
- `mlxtend`: Utilized for some utility functions in the genetic algorithm.
- `pickle`: Used for saving and loading model checkpoints or intermediate results.
- `random`: For generating random numbers and randomization in genetic algorithms.
- `time`: For timing and profiling parts of the code.

Additionally, the following libraries from scikit-learn are used:

- `MLPClassifier` from `sklearn.neural_network` for building the Multilayer Perceptron model.
- `StandardScaler` and `normalize` from `sklearn.preprocessing` for data preprocessing.
- `PCA` from `sklearn.decomposition` for Principal Component Analysis if needed.

## Usage

1. Open and run the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to execute the main project code.
2. The notebook contains step-by-step instructions and explanations for each part of the project, including data preprocessing, model definition, training, and genetic algorithm fine-tuning.
3. Customize the hyperparameters, dataset paths, and other configurations as needed for your specific task.
4. View the results, visualizations, and analysis provided in the notebook.

## Important Notes

- This project assumes you have a basic understanding of machine learning, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and Python programming.
- Make sure to install the required libraries mentioned in the "Dependencies" section using `pip` or `conda` before running the code.
- Adjust the hyperparameters and settings in the code to match your specific problem and dataset.
- It is recommended to have a GPU-enabled environment for faster training if dealing with large datasets or complex models.
